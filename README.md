//Ok so I was ordering food from restaurants and I enjoyed design ideas from several sites which led to this brilliant idea of attempting to create a template based on some of the designs I saw and blend it together.

//I know the code could use a HUGE overhaul and cleanup but I will post this here as a first project and come back to it in the future to check my progress!!! ≧◡≦

//What I thought was the most important part of this small project was blending ideas together into a semi-decent design. (My eye for design is not the best but I am sincerely trying ┐(‘～`；)┌ ) and the Javascript. Oh boy. The Javascript had me reading articles and watching quite an amount of videos trying to get the 'querySelectorAll' to work properly. I sat for atleast a bit over an hour learning what I was doing wrong with just that one part alone, but when I understood why, the realisation was just satisfying.

//Overall I had fun. Even as hard and frustrating as it is as a beginner for now, I truly had fun learning and ATTEMPTING to understand what was right and wrong with what I did.


IF someone actually decides to check this out, I would very much appreciate feedback and pointers on how I could improve possibly something such as my "handwriting" or the way I organised/wrote the mess in the HTML, CSS, and JS files. (Download index.html, style.scss, script.js, and the images.) Thank you for checking this out! (Whether it is me from the future or someone out there~)  (~￣▽￣)~
